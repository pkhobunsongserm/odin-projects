        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ok look, come on now, who doesn't love a little tiramisu in their lives? Strong coffee flavor, succulent and creammy mascarpone, and best of all, no baking needed. </p>
        <p>It is recommended to start making this dish early because the lady fingers (or sometimes I subbed in with a buttercake) will need time to soak up all the coffee flavor. Also, rum is called in this recipe but if you do not want alcohol in your dessert, just leave it out and put more coffee in.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rum (optional)</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies or butter cake</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks and sugar together in a medium saucepan until well blended.</li>
            <li>Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture. Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours. Serve in whatever size you'd like (or just have the whole thing to yourself, you deserve it!)</li>
        </ol>
